In order to run through the motions, you need to use Hebrew. Here's a sample name and surname:

Name: אודות

Surname: התראות

Cell: (050) 0833294

Social Security Number: 330914268

You can send the OTP to any number because we're in develop mode which means that it will not send. But choose a cellphone number that you'll remember because you'll need to login with that one from that point onwards. Check the logs on the backend service (in `docker-compose` for the OTP to use).
